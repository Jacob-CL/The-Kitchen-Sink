Since we can control whether the email and password are read from a json object, this means that we are not limited to inserting on strings as input. A typical MongoDB login bypass can be used here with the payload looking like this:

{
    "email": {
        "$ne": 0
    }, 
    "password": {
        "$ne": 0
    } 
}

A payload like this will force MongoDB to fetch a user where email is not equal to 0 and password is not equal to 0, in our case this would be the first user, and since a valid user is returned we get authenticated and retrieve the flag!
